# Machine Learning Module Pure Python: Data Science Tools without Numpy or Scipy or SKLearn

![Machine Learning Module Pure Python](https://github.com/ThomIves/MachineLearningPurePy/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Pure_Py.png)
> This is a module of machine learning tools for data science using pure python WITHOUT numpy, scipy or sklearn and is covered in greater detail across several blog posts from https://integratedmlai.com/.

Our goal is to better understand principles of machine learning tools by exploring how to code them ourselves ...

Meaning, we are seeking to code these tools without using the **AWESOME** python modules available for machine learning. 

These efforts **will** provide insights and better understanding. This post stands on the shoulders of the posts before it, and presents the addition of our first real machine learning tool in a class structure for better ease of use.

If you've come here initially, I hope that you will explore the blog and follow it's posts on using the other repositories, and I hope it helps you gain deeper insights into machine learning and data science.

## Deploying / Publishing

I would appreciate it, as you share your work leveraged from this set of scripts, if you would please keep a referral back to my github repo. Thanks! I'd do the same for you. :-)

## Contributing

I am open to share the development and improvements of this with others, but it has been solo up until now. Let me know if you'd like to contribute.
